Core Principles

Design for vision first. Users form an impression in ~0.1s and decide to stay/leave within a few seconds.

UI must communicate structure, priority, and affordances instantly using shape, space, contrast, and color.

Treat white space, color, and contrast as functional tools, not decoration.

Use Gestalt principles to control how users group and interpret elements.

Aim to reduce cognitive load: remove clutter; chunk information; make relationships obvious.

Evaluate visual hierarchy with a 5-second blur test.

Layout
Gestalt-Based Layout Rules
Emergence

Users recognize overall shape/outline before details.

Rule:

Make the overall layout shape obvious (e.g., clear columns, cards, hero block) before adding fine details or decoration.

Ensure primary interactive elements look like their class (e.g., buttons look like buttons) before styling.

Reification & Closure

People fill in missing details when enough information is provided.

Rules:

You can omit non-essential visual boundaries if alignment and spacing strongly imply structure (e.g., card grids without visible borders).

Use partial shapes and clean grids to achieve minimalist layouts; rely on users completing the pattern.

Example (grid layout)

3 images in a column-aligned grid, no visible borders. Equal widths and consistent spacing cause users to “see” the grid and parse content in three columns.

Multistability

Ambiguous visuals flip between interpretations.

Rules:

Avoid layouts that can read as two different patterns (e.g., overlapping shapes that could be figure or background).

Run quick usability checks: ask new viewers “what is this?” and ensure the answer matches your intent.

Invariance

Users recognize objects across rotation/scale/deformation.

Rule:

Keep core shapes and patterns consistent across responsive breakpoints (icons, button shapes, card layouts) so users recognize them even when size or orientation changes.

Grouping & Proximity
White Space as Structure

White space types:

Visual: around graphics/icons/images.

Layout: margins, paddings, gutters.

Text: line spacing and letter spacing.

Content: gaps between blocks/columns.

Rules:

Use consistent vertical rhythm between related elements; increase spacing between unrelated groups.

Use layout white space to form clear sections: header, main content, secondary navigation, footer.

Group items by proximity: items closer together are interpreted as related.

Form example (labels & fields):

Place labels immediately adjacent to their input fields (above or left, with minimal gap).

Avoid labels far from fields; even small gaps can decrease confidence and completion.

Enclosure

Encircle related content to unify it visually.

Rules:

Wrap related content (e.g., post title + media + actions) inside a card/container with shared background or border.

Use enclosure plus a slightly different background color to create visual modules (e.g., feed items, settings sections).

Example (post card):

One card contains: avatar, title, text, media, and actions (like/comment/share). The enclosing card and shared background mark all of these as one object.

Chunking & Cognitive Load

Short-term memory is limited (~3–7 meaningful items at once).

Chunking = grouping related items into meaningful sets.

When to chunk:

Users must remember information later (e-learning, onboarding flows, complex settings).

Mobile or noisy environments where attention is fragmented.

Long forms or lengthy option lists.

Rules:

Group content and fields into thematic sections (e.g., “Personal Info”, “Shipping”, “Payment”).

Within each chunk, limit items to a manageable set (aim for ~3–7 items per chunk when memorization matters).

Use headings and spacing to separate chunks.

For browsing lists (e.g., products), chunk at category level, not at individual item level, to avoid users seeing only tiny groups of items per page.

Example (product categories vs. items):

Category page: 6–8 prominent category tiles in a grid (chunking improves scanability).

Product list within a category: continuous grid or list of many items (no artificial chunking into 6-item pages that slow browsing).

Attracting Attention With Space

Absence of elements makes remaining elements stand out.

Rules:

Add extra white space around primary CTAs and hero content sections.

Reduce surrounding clutter: avoid dense sidebars or competing banners near the main task.

In crowded designs, tighten space around low-priority items to visually compress them and emphasize key areas via contrast in space.

Example (search vs. portal):

Minimal search page: single input field, logo, and a few unobtrusive links → effortless focus on search.

Portal page with many competing modules (news, sports, ads, stocks) → user attention is fragmented; avoid this when a single primary task exists.

Visual Hierarchy & the 5-Second Blur Test
Blur Test Procedure

Take a screenshot of the page.

Apply a Gaussian blur of ~5–10px (Photoshop) or

In Chrome dev tools, set on body:
-webkit-filter: blur(5px);

Look at the blurred page for ~5 seconds.

Note what jumps out first: text blocks, shapes, buttons.

Compare that to intended priorities (e.g., primary CTA, headline, key value proposition).

Iteration:

If the wrong element dominates, adjust:

Size (increase/decrease).

Color (use more or less contrast).

Brightness (foreground/background contrast).

Spacing (more isolation for important items).

Position (move key items to prominent zones like top-center).

Repeat blur test until what stands out matches the intended hierarchy.

Typography

The book only gives limited typography guidance; focus is on spacing & link styling.

Rules:

Use generous line-height to improve readability, especially for long-form content.

Maintain consistent paragraph spacing; use larger gaps between sections than between paragraphs.

Avoid over-dense text blocks; break long content into short paragraphs and subheadings.

For logos/brand marks within content:

Surround with extra space instead of enlarging to grab attention.

Link-specific typographic rules:

All links must visually differ from body text (color and/or underline).

All links of the same type must look the same:

Navigation links share one style.

Content links share another but are consistent among themselves.

For multiple link categories:

Use color as the primary differentiator (most powerful similarity/contrast signal).

Use size/weight for secondary differentiation.

Example (links):

Content links: blue, medium weight, underlined on hover.

Username/category links: same blue, smaller size → clearly related but secondary.

Action links (e.g., “Comment”, “Share”): grey but bold → distinct category of “actions”, still recognized as clickable.

Color
Color Theory
Contrast

Each color has a direct opposite on the color wheel (complement); pairing them produces strong contrast (e.g., blue vs. orange).

Strong color contrast is one of the fastest ways to:

Separate foreground vs. background.

Highlight primary actions.

Complementation

Colors adjacent on the wheel support one another (e.g., purple with blue or pink).

Useful for:

Harmonious backgrounds.

Smooth gradients.

Subtle section differentiation.

Vibrancy

Warm colors (red, orange, yellow): energetic, attention-grabbing, aggressive if overused.

Cool colors (green, blue, purple): calm, stable, safe; darker shades can feel serious or luxurious.

Rule of thumb:

Use warm colors for focal elements (alerts, CTAs) against cool backgrounds for maximum attention.

Use cool or neutral colors for large areas and background; reserve intense warm colors for limited, high-priority elements.

Emotional Associations (Western-centric)

Use these emotions as directional signals, not hard rules.

Red

Promotes: power, urgency, danger, youth.

Use for: warnings, alerts, emergency messages; high-urgency CTAs.

Caution: can feel aggressive/angering; avoid saturating entire UI.

Orange

Promotes: friendliness, creativity, energy.

Use for: playful CTAs, friendly brands, secondary emphasis.

Works well as both primary and accent color.

Yellow

Bright: happiness, enthusiasm, optimism.

Dark/gold: antiquity, wisdom, authority.

Use for: highlights and accents; avoid large pure-yellow backgrounds which can be tiring.

Green

Promotes: growth, stability, nature, finances.

Use for: success states, financial products, eco themes.

Dark green: wealth, stability; bright green: freshness, vitality.

Blue

Light: openness, friendliness, safety.

Dark: reliability, professionalism, seriousness.

Use for: corporate sites, utilities, tools, social platforms, trust-building.

Purple

Light (lavender): romance, gentleness.

Dark: luxury, mystery, decadence.

Use for: fashion, premium experiences, creative products.

Black

Promotes: power, sophistication, edginess.

Use for: high-end brands, hero sections, strong typography.

Combine with white and simple layouts for a classic, elegant feel.

White

Promotes: cleanliness, simplicity, virtue.

Use for: backgrounds, minimalist layouts, negative space.

Ideal for showcasing colorful artwork or product photography.

Gray

Promotes: neutrality, professionalism, restraint.

Use for: backgrounds, secondary UI chrome, subtle dividers.

Tune the shade for more “white-like” (light) or “black-like” (dark) character.

Beige

Promotes: earthy, humble, or paper-like warmth.

Adapts to surrounding colors; used mainly as a background.

Darker beige: organic, classic; lighter: fresh yet soft.

Ivory/Cream

Promotes: comfort, soft minimalism, warmth.

Use to soften harsh contrast between pure white and dark elements.

Color Schemes
Triadic

3 colors equally spaced (120° apart) on the color wheel.

Use when: you want balanced, safe color harmony.

Implementation:

1 color for background.

1 for primary elements (CTA, main highlights).

1 for secondary elements (sub-headings, secondary CTAs).

Compound / Split Complementary

4-color scheme: two pairs of complementary colors.

Use when: you want strong visual impact with multiple focal areas (e.g., rich illustrations or landing pages).

Implementation:

Use one pair for background vs. main content.

Use the other pair for secondary content and accents.

Analogous

3+ colors adjacent on the wheel (e.g., blue–teal–green).

Use when: you want a cohesive, calm feel.

Implementation:

Use analogous range for most of the UI.

Introduce one contrasting color sparingly for CTAs.

Components
Buttons

Light/Dark Contrast & Depth

Simulate depth by:

Darker color for “pressed” state.

Slight shadow or darker bottom edge even in otherwise flat design.

Rules:

Primary buttons must have highest color contrast against their background.

Hover and active states must be clearly visible (e.g., reversed foreground/background colors, increased brightness/darkness).

Example:

Default: blue background, white text.

Hover: slightly lighter or darker blue, maybe outline or shadow change.

Active: darkest shade or inverted colors.

Navigation Elements

Place navigation items on a shared line to signal they are equal in hierarchy (Gestalt continuation).

Vertical icon-only nav:

Use consistent color, size, and spacing to signal all icons are the same “level”.

Show labels on hover/expand to reveal meaning while saving vertical space.

Popup/Modal Nav

Dim entire page behind modal (figure-ground relationship).

Keep modal fixed while underlying content scrolls to maintain it as the primary figure.

Cards & Content Blocks

Use consistent card styling (shape, background color, hover behavior) for items representing the same type (posts, patterns, products).

Cards should:

Be clickable as a whole or clearly indicate the primary clickable area.

Maintain same structure: thumbnail → title → meta (price, date, location).

Example (pattern library cards):

Grid of equal cards, each with a thumbnail and title.

On hover: same interaction on each card (e.g., overlay with more info) to reinforce similarity.

Interaction Patterns
Similarity & Consistency

Links & Actions

Content links (to pages) share one style; action links (comment, share, like) share another.

Username or category links can share color but differ in size/weight to show separate hierarchy.

Product Tiles / Cards

Use same shape, size, and structure for all products of a type; similarities communicate that each tile behaves the same way.

Figure-Ground for Overlays & Focus

To highlight an overlay (newsletter, modal, cart confirmation):

Darken or blur the background page.

Make overlay brighter and sharper.

Keep overlay fixed while background scrolls if needed.

Example (newsletter overlay):

Page dims to 60–70% brightness.

Center modal with clear close control; overlay content remains crisp.

Closure in Interaction

Example (add to cart):

On “Add to cart” click:

Change button text to “Added!” or similar.

Update cart item count in header.

Show small, temporary modal or tooltip confirming addition.

This skips extra navigation to cart page; users infer action completion from feedback.

Continuation in Flows & Menus

Use horizontal lines or item alignment to suggest step-by-step flow.

In menus:

First row: content types (e.g., Articles, Videos).

Second row: filters/categories (e.g., Design, Business).

Users infer distinct levels based on row alignment.

Navigation

Combine similarity, continuation, and contrast to make nav structure obvious.

Rules:

Top-level navigation:

Items aligned in a single row.

Same font, size, and hover behavior.

Subnavigation:

Aligned in a separate row or column.

Slightly smaller or less contrast than top-level.

Mark current location via:

Color and/or underline.

Background pill or tab styling.

Vertical Nav Icons

When using icon-only vertical nav:

Icons share size, color, and alignment.

Provide text labels on hover or when selected.

Keep spacing equal to exploit similarity and grouping.

States & Feedback

Hover

Use subtle color or contrast changes (e.g., reverse colors or adjust brightness) on:

Buttons.

Cards.

Navigation items.

Keep hover behavior consistent for the same type of element.

Active/Pressed

Stronger feedback than hover:

Darkest or lightest state of button color.

Slight position shift (1–2px) to mimic pressing.

Progress & Confirmation

Use microfeedback (text changes, icon ticks, count updates, mini modals) to confirm actions without forcing hard page transitions.

Forms & Validation

Focus is mainly on layout and chunking rather than explicit validation states.

Rules:

Place labels closest to their fields, avoiding ambiguity:

Above or to the left of inputs.

Never float labels far away or between columns.

Group related fields under section headings with added vertical space.

For long forms:

Break into logical sections (e.g., personal, shipping, billing).

Use progress indicator if multi-step.

Avoid overwhelming users with a single massive block of fields; chunk into smaller visible groups.

Error Handling

The book touches error signaling indirectly via color and emphasis.

Guidelines derived from content:

Use red sparingly to indicate serious issues or required attention.

Ensure error messages:

Are placed close to the problematic field (proximity).

Are visually differentiated via color and contrast.

Don’t rely on color alone; include icons or text pattern changes where possible.

Accessibility

While not an accessibility manual, the content implies several accessibility-friendly rules:

Maintain clear foreground/background contrast so users can distinguish elements and text.

Use spacing and grouping instead of only color or borders to convey relationships.

Avoid ambiguous, multistable visuals that require interpretation; strive for single, clear meaning.

Do not rely exclusively on color (e.g., red vs. green) to distinguish states when possible; combine with icons or text labels.

Content & Microcopy

Visual organization can sometimes replace explicit labels (e.g., product tiles obviously represent products without a “Products” heading), but:

Do this only when similarity and contrast are strong enough.

Copy that is not essential to the main task should be:

Secondary in hierarchy (smaller, less contrast, or farther away).

Avoided where UI patterns and visuals already communicate meaning well.

Motion

Motion is relatively light in the book; mainly hover and feedback.

Guidelines:

Use subtle animations to:

Reveal labels or details on hover (e.g., icon-only nav expanding to show text).

Fill or highlight category icons on hover.

Slide down cart confirmation notifications.

Keep motion:

Fast (a few hundred ms).

Purposeful (reinforcing feedback or hierarchy, not just decoration).

Consistent for similar interactions.
