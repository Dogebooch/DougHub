            <h3>Answer & Critique</h3>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer: C</strong></p>
            
            <h4>Educational Objective:</h4>
            <p>Treat a patient with mild travelers' diarrhea.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Points</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Travelers' diarrhea is typically self-limited in immunocompetent patients (resolving within 5-7 days), and mild infections require no treatment other than supportive care.</li>
                <li>Up to 80% of travelers' diarrhea infections are caused by pathogenic intestinal bacteria, including various strains of Escherichia coli (enterotoxigenic E. coli is the most common), Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Vibrio species.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Fluid replacement is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Travelers' diarrhea affects one third of travelers to developing nations with poor food and water safety practices, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Central and South America, and Southern Asia.</p>
