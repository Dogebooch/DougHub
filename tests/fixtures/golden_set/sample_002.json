This patient's chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar adenopathy. Overall, the patient's presentation is concerning for sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis involving the ocular system should be followed-up by ophthalmology as an outpatient, and corticosteroids should be used for treatment.</p>\n                    \n                    <p>Sarcoidosis can also be treated on an outpatient basis, provided there are no acute findings (eg, hemoptysis or new cardiomyopathy). The patient may do best when referred to a sarcoidosis subspecialty center, if available. Outpatient referral to pulmonology would also be indicated for this patient.</p>\n                </div>\n                \n                <div class=\"tab-content\" id=\"distractors\">\n                    <h4>Distractor Analysis</h4>\n                    <p><strong>Admit to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics</strong> - This patient has no evidence of infection at this time, so intravenous antibiotics are unwarranted. Consolidation on chest x-ray with concern for pneumonia would be an indication for antibiotics. The patient's x-ray shows bilateral hilar adenopathy consistent with sarcoidosis.</p>\n                    \n                    <p><strong>Transfer to a tertiary care center for immediate subspecialty care</strong> - Although this patient may be best served by management at an outpatient center with expertise in sarcoidosis, her current presentation does not necessitate immediate transfer. Outpatient referral for follow-up is adequate given the lack of severe symptoms.</p>\n                    \n                    <p><strong>Consult ophthalmology for emergent operative treatment</strong> - This patient's uveitis does not necessitate emergent operative treatment at this time. Mainstays of ocular sarcoidosis treatment include corticosteroid eye drops to reduce inflammation for mild uveitis, systemic steroids for moderate to severe uveitis, and immunosuppressants for failure of other treatments.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",
